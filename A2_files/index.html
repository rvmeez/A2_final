				The high number of COVID-19 cases in countries like the USA, India, and France visible on the map can 
				be attributed to several factors. For example, these nations have large populations, extensive international travel, 
				and densely populated urban areas, creating favorable conditions for the rapid spread of the virus. 
				Additionally, variations in healthcare infrastructure, testing capacities, and adherence to preventive 
				measures have influenced the reported case numbers, emphasizing the disparities in the global response 
				to the pandemic.
